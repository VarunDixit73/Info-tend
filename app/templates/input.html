            <p>"Info-tend‚Äù is a machine learning based OCR
                (Optical Character Recognition) that utilizes computer vision to distinguish
                printed or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical
                documents, such as a scanned paper document as primary feature and an
                attendance management system as our secondary goal. Our team is utilizing
                the latest technologies in Computer Vision and Deep Learning to efficiently
                use OCR for verification of text. The end users need to register themselves
                and provide the system with handwritten copy of text displayed by
                themselves as input, after the registration our machine learning model
                building using Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) will create a profile in
                which the user's handwriting style will be stored and will be used in the
                future.</p>
